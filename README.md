# php-glassdoor-project
Programming project using PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, and CSS to interact with Glassdoor's API. 
JavaScript charts are powered by amCharts. Simple HTML Dom was used also. This was a group 
project effort collaborated by three members for a graduate level course. The idea was to 
implement a crawler. The code can definitely be improved and expanded upon.
